# Patient_Outcome_Prediction

## This project aims to predict patient outcomes based on textual descriptions of their symptoms and medical history. By analyzing patient data, the model provides insights into possible diagnoses or next steps, assisting in decision-making for medical professionals.The project utilizes machine learning techniques to create a predictive model trained on a dataset of common diseases and injuries, providing a foundational example of applying AI to healthcare.

Dataset
* Name: MedText Dataset
* Size: 1.4k rows, 2 columns
* Columns:
  - Prompt: Text describing patient symptoms, history, or complaints.
  - Completion: The most likely outcome or diagnosis for the given prompt.
* Data Content: Includes descriptions of the top 100 most common diseases and 30 most common injuries.

### Objective
Build a machine learning model that can:

Accurately predict patient outcomes based on input symptoms.
Handle textual data efficiently through preprocessing and feature engineering.
Provide a foundational framework for more advanced healthcare AI applications.

### Workflow
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Steps:
Handle missing data, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Clean text data by:
Removing punctuation, special characters, and stopwords.
Normalizing whitespace and converting to lowercase.
Tokenize text data to prepare it for vectorization.
Tools: Python libraries such as pandas, textacy, and nltk.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Goals:
Understand the data distribution and common patterns.
Analyze text length, token frequencies, and word importance.
Visualize token counts and common entities in patient descriptions.
Tools: matplotlib, seaborn, spacy.
3. Feature Engineering
Techniques:
Vectorize text data using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Explore n-grams to capture phrase-level features.
4. Model Development
Approach:
Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
Optimize for accuracy, precision, and recall.
Tools: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
5. Model Evaluation
Assess model performance using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-score
ROC-AUC
Compare multiple models to select the best-performing one.

### Dependencies
